Thanks for reaching out! Right now, Iâ€™m not the best person to help with this. Iâ€™m going to connect you to my colleague [Name] in the [Name of the Department] Department. Do you mind waiting a moment while I explain to [Name] what youâ€™ve just explained to me?
I appreciate you explaining that to me. Iâ€™m going to connect you to our [Name of Team] team. Iâ€™ll let them know what youâ€™re reaching out about. ðŸ™‚
I just need to check something. Do you mind if I put you on hold for a moment?
Great question! I want to pull up your account details to check it out. Can I put you on hold?
Sorry about the wait! All of our agents are helping others right now. If you donâ€™t mind waiting for just a few minutes, weâ€™ll reach back out as soon as possible.
All our agents are busy right now. You can expect to wait [this long] until the next agent is free to chat with you.
Thanks so much for being patient! Weâ€™ll be with you soon.
Thank you for waiting! Iâ€™m here nowâ€”sorry about that wait.
